# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
the diagonal asserts because understanding the board position was difficult aswel as splitting the string into 3 lines.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
you would ask for inputs in position instead of using asserts
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I dont know how I would create an offensive computer but I would probably give it different functions for different first moves the oppenets makes and build a defensive program that wouldnt allow the oppent to get three in a row.
